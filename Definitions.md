API - a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other

## OAuth2
- a authentication system
  
### Token based authentication
- A method where users are identified using a temporary, secure token (like a string or ID) issued after login. The server validates this token with each action to confirm the userâ€™s identity without needing to store credentials. Can be used with simple alias systems or full logins.
- Can be implemented without OAuth2.  
- Useful for tournament tracking or action permissions.
