# Project overview for transcendence.

### Mandatory part
This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!

Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities allowing
to play Pong with all your friends!

your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum
Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific
modules.

It is mandatory to do minimum of 7 major modules, 2 minor modules count as 1 major module.
##### III.2 Minimal technical requirement
• You are free to develop the site, [with or without a backend.](with_without_backend.md)
    ◦ If you choose to include a backend, it must be written in pure PHP without
frameworks. However, this requirement can be overridden by the Framework
module.


modules
 You will be able to choose the modules you want among a large list, but each module and mandatory element contains technical constraints you cannot bypass. So you can select the topics you like, but not technologies you like.

Some modules may depend on others, some modules may conflict with
others.
