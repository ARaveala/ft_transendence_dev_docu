# Project overview for transcendence.

### Mandatory part
"This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!. 

Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities allowing
to play Pong with all your friends!"

The core of the project is to build an online multiplayer Pong game.
The final product should be a full stack web application with user accounts and a playable game.

your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum
Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific
modules.

It is mandatory to do minimum of 7 major modules, 2 minor modules count as 1 major module.


#### Modules that help fulfill the requirements
- Minor module: Support on all devices: The overview specifies "web application," potentially implying it should be accessible on various devices. This module directly addresses that.

- Major module: Standard user management...: The brief mentions a user management system is necessary for the game (with user accounts). This module provides a complete solution for that.


# ‼️  A Crucial Rule: Using Libraries
As we start working on this project, a key rule to remember is about third party libraries and tools.

It is absolutely mandatory that any direct instruction about a library or tool from the project subject is followed.

You are prohibited from using a library that provides an immediate, complete solution for an entire feature or module. However, you are allowed to use a small library that handles a simple, unique task that is a small part of a larger feature.

Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of a third-party library or tool must be followed. This means if we choose a module like database module, the strict phrasing "if we choose to have a database we must follow the requirements of that module" , this restricts us to use SQLlite. Devation from that rule means we have broken the rules of the project and it may lead to a fail.

The Golden Rule: When you are evaluated, the key question will be whether you can justify using a tool. The evaluator will determine if the library's use is legitimate (e.g., a simple tool for hashing a password) or if it's a shortcut that solves an entire feature for you (e.g., a complete Pong game library).

This rule is designed to challenge you to build things from scratch and understand the underlying concepts, not just rely on pre-built solutions.

```
- The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
- Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
- The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
- During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
- During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).

IF you wish to alter files , please fork first and dont alter files without warning others. method of warning will be added, it might be informing in group chat, it may be we have 
to create new files and do a comparison , it maybe we have to split tasks to ensure we do not all tamper the same files . 

better detials required here (hopefully resolved monday )
