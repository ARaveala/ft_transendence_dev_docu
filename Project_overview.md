# Project overview for transcendence.

### Mandatory part
"This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!. 

Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities allowing
to play Pong with all your friends!"

The core of the project is to build an online multiplayer Pong game.
The final product should be a full stack web application with user accounts and a playable game.

your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum
Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific
modules.

It is mandatory to do minimum of 7 major modules, 2 minor modules count as 1 major module.


#### Modules that help fulfill the requirements
- Minor module: Support on all devices: The overview specifies "web application," potentially implying it should be accessible on various devices. This module directly addresses that.

- Major module: Standard user management...: The brief mentions a user management system is necessary for the game (with user accounts). This module provides a complete solution for that.


# ‼️  IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER ‼️ 
- The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
- Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
- The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
- During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
- During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).
