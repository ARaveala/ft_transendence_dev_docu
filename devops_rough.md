These modules focus on enhancing the project’s infrastructure and architecture. The
major modules address infrastructure setup for efficient log management using ELK
(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), designing the backend as microservices for flexibility and scalability, and implementing Prometheus/Grafana for comprehensive system
monitoring.

----

## Major module: Infrastructure Setup with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
for Log Management.
The objective of this major module is to establish a robust infrastructure for log
management and analysis using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Key features and goals include:
◦ Deploy Elasticsearch to efficiently store and index log data, ensuring it is easily
searchable and accessible.
◦ Configure Logstash to collect, process, and transform log data from various
sources, sending it to Elasticsearch.
◦ Set up Kibana for visualizing log data, creating dashboards, and generating
insights from log events.
◦ Define data retention and archiving policies to manage log data storage effectively.
◦ Implement security measures to protect log data and access to the ELK stack
components.
This major module aims to establish a powerful log management and analysis system using the ELK stack, enabling effective troubleshooting, monitoring, and insights into the system’s operation and performance.

----
Explanation: This module is about setting up a centralized system for logging and analyzing everything that happens in your application. The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) helps you collect logs from all your services and visualize them to find problems and understand how your app is being used.

#### Value of this module:
This module provides a powerful solution for centralized logging and monitoring. The ELK stack allows you to collect, analyze, and visualize logs from all parts of your application, making it much easier to debug issues, monitor performance, and understand user behavior in a complex, multi-service environment.

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This module is a deep dive into the world of DevOps and infrastructure, which is a completely new concept if you've only worked on application code. The learning curve is very steep, as you'll be working with a full "stack" of tools that all have their own configuration and purpose. The concepts are more about system administration and networking than application code.

#### Modules to be Cautious With:
None. This module is for infrastructure, which can be added later.

#### Complementary Modules:
- Major module: Designing the Backend as Microservices (centralized logging is crucial for distributed systems).
- Minor module: Monitoring system (complementary for a full observability stack).
- To build this module you will need:
- Docker containers for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
- Configuration for Logstash to receive logs from your services
- Dashboards and visualizations set up in Kibana
- A Docker Compose file to orchestrate the stack

## Minor module: Monitoring system.
The goal of this minor module is to set up a comprehensive monitoring system using
Prometheus and Grafana . Key features and goals include:
◦ Deploy Prometheus as the monitoring and alerting toolkit to collect metrics
and monitor the health and performance of various system components.
◦ Configure data exporters and integrations to capture metrics from different
services, databases, and infrastructure components.
◦ Create custom dashboards and visualizations using Grafana to provide realtime insights into system metrics and performance.
◦ Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to proactively detect and respond to
critical issues and anomalies.
◦ Ensure proper data retention and storage strategies for historical metrics data.
◦ Implement secure authentication and access control mechanisms for Grafana
to protect sensitive monitoring data.

This minor module aims to establish a robust monitoring infrastructure using
Prometheus and Grafana , enabling real-time visibility into system metrics and
proactive issue detection for improved system performance and reliability.

----
Explanation: This module is about setting up a system to keep a close eye on your application’s health in real-time. Prometheus collects data about how your services are performing, and Grafana helps you create visual dashboards to see everything at a glance.

#### Value of this module:
This module provides real-time insights into the health and performance of your application. By monitoring key metrics, you can proactively identify and resolve issues before they affect users. This is a crucial practice for ensuring the reliability and stability of your service.

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This module is a great introduction to the world of application monitoring. The learning curve is moderate, as you'll be using new tools, but the core idea of collecting data and visualizing it is straightforward. It's a key part of professional software development that you may not have encountered in C/C++.

#### Modules to be Cautious With:
None. This module is for infrastructure, which can be added later.

#### Complementary Modules:
- Major module: Designing the Backend as Microservices.
- Major module: Infrastructure Setup with ELK.

To build this module you will need:
- Docker containers for Prometheus and Grafana
- Exporters to collect metrics from your services and database
- Custom metric endpoints in your backend
- Dashboards and alerting rules configured in Grafana
----

## Major module: Designing the Backend as Microservices.
The goal of this major module is to architect the backend of the system using a
microservices approach. Key features and objectives include:
◦ Divide the backend into smaller, loosely-coupled microservices, each responsible for specific functions or features.
◦ Define clear boundaries and interfaces between microservices to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling.
◦ Implement communication mechanisms between microservices, such as RESTful APIs or message queues, to facilitate data exchange and coordination.
◦ Ensure that each microservice is responsible for a single, well-defined task or
business capability, promoting maintainability and scalability.
This major module aims to enhance the system’s architecture by adopting a microservices design approach, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the backend components.

----

Explanation: Instead of building a single, large backend, this module is about breaking your backend into smaller, independent services. This makes your application more flexible and easier to scale, but it also adds complexity to managing all the different pieces.

#### Value of this module:
This architectural approach makes the application more flexible, scalable, and resilient. By breaking the backend into smaller, independent services, you can develop and deploy different parts of the application more quickly and scale individual services to handle increased load without affecting the entire system.

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This module is a major architectural shift from a single C++ executable. The learning curve is very steep, as you're no longer thinking about a single program but about multiple, independent services that need to communicate with each other. This is a core concept in modern distributed systems, and it will challenge you to think about program design in a new way.

#### Modules to be Cautious With:
This module overrides the implicit assumption of a single backend in the mandatory part. It adds complexity but offers scalability.

#### Complementary Modules:
- Major module: Infrastructure Setup with ELK (for logging).
- Minor module: Monitoring system (for observability).
- Major module: Replace Basic Pong with Server-Side Pong (game and user logic can be separate services).

To build this module you will need:
- A reverse proxy or gateway to route requests (NGINX, Traefik)
- Inter-service communication mechanisms (REST APIs, message queues)
- A containerization strategy for each service
- A plan for deploying and scaling services independently
