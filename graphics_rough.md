#### Major module: Implementing Advanced 3D Techniques
This major module,"Graphics," focuses on enhancing the visual aspects of the Pong
game. It introduces the use of advanced 3D techniques to create a more immersive
gaming experience. Specifically, the Pong game will be developed using Babylon.js
to achieve the desired visual effects.
◦ Advanced 3D Graphics: The primary goal of this module is to implement
advanced 3D graphics techniques to elevate the visual quality of the Pong
game. By utilizing Babylon.js , the goal is to create stunning visual effects
that immerse players in the gaming environment.
◦ Immersive Gameplay: The incorporation of advanced 3D techniques enhances
the overall gameplay experience by providing users with a visually engaging
and captivating Pong game.
◦ Technology Integration: The chosen technology for this module is Babylon.js .
These tools will be used to create the 3D graphics, ensuring compatibility and
optimal performance.
This major module aims to revolutionize the Pong game’s visual elements by introducing advanced 3D techniques. Through the use of Babylon.js , we aim to provide
players with an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience

Explanation: This module is about taking the visual experience of your game to the next level by building it in a 3D environment. Instead of simple 2D graphics, you will use a library like Babylon.js to create 3D models, lighting, and a camera to view the scene.

#### Value of this module:
This module delivers a visually stunning and immersive user experience. Moving from 2D to 3D graphics can make the game feel more modern, engaging, and dynamic, which is a huge differentiator for the final project.

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This module will feel familiar if you've ever worked with a graphics library in C++. While the language is JavaScript, the core concepts of rendering, a game loop, and a scene graph are the same. The learning curve is manageable if you've already touched on graphics, but you will have to get familiar with the new library's API.

#### Modules to be Cautious With:
Minor module: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Integration. SSR pre-renders HTML, but 3D is a client-side JavaScript canvas. The SSR module will still work, but it will only provide the initial page structure; the 3D content will only appear once the client-side JavaScript loads.

#### Complementary Modules:
- Minor module: Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end (for UI around the 3D canvas).
- All gameplay modules (3D graphics enhance the visual experience).

To build this module you will need:
- The Babylon.js library
- An HTML <canvas> element
- A rendering loop to handle the 3D scene
- 3D models, textures, and lighting
- Game physics and logic for the 3D environment
