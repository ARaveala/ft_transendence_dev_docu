In this major module, you are required to use a specific web framework for backend
development: Fastify with Node.js .
You can create the backend without using the constraints of this

the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if you
follow its requirements.

• Minor module: Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end.
Your frontend development must use the Tailwind CSS in addition of the Typescript, and nothing else.

module by using the default front-end directives (as specified above
in the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if
you follow its requirements.
