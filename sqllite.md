# üóÉÔ∏è SQLite Overview

SQLite is a **lightweight, serverless SQL database** that stores all data in a single file. It‚Äôs widely used in mobile apps, embedded systems, and small-scale web applications due to its simplicity and portability.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Characteristics

- **Single-file storage**  
  All data is stored in one `.sqlite` file, making it easy to move or back up.

- **No server required**  
  SQLite runs in-process with your application‚Äîno need to install or manage a separate database server.

- **Easy setup**  
  Just include the SQLite library and start querying. Ideal for quick prototyping or local development.

## üîÑ Comparison: SQLite vs. MariaDB

| Feature                  | **SQLite**                                | **MariaDB**                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**         | Serverless, embedded                      | Client-server model                       |
| **Storage**              | Single file                               | Multi-file, managed by server             |
| **Concurrency**          | Limited (single writer)                   | High concurrency with row-level locking   |
| **SQL Features**         | Basic subset                              | Full SQL support (joins, procedures, etc.)|
| **User Management**      | None (manual implementation required)     | Built-in users, roles, and permissions    |
| **Performance**          | Great for small apps                      | Scales well for large, multi-user systems |
| **Use Case**             | Mobile apps, local tools, small web apps  | Web servers, enterprise apps, cloud DBs   |

## üåê Multi-user and Remote Access Considerations

SQLite is not designed for high-concurrency or remote access scenarios. Here's what you need to know:

- **Single Writer Limitation**  
  SQLite uses **database-level locking**, meaning only one write operation can occur at a time. Multiple simultaneous writes can cause contention, slowdowns, or failures.

- **Remote Access Challenges**  
  SQLite is file-based and doesn't support remote connections natively. You'd need to expose it via an API or use a file-sharing mechanism, which introduces latency and risk.

- **Workarounds for Multi-user Access**  
  - Use **connection pooling** and queue writes to avoid collisions.
  - Consider **replicating the database** for read-heavy workloads, but syncing changes is complex.
  - For true multi-user remote access, consider switching to a client-server DB like PostgreSQL or MariaDB.

---

## üîê Access Control and User Management

SQLite does **not** support built-in user roles or authentication. You must implement access control at the **application level**:

- Use app-level logic to restrict access to certain queries or data.
- Protect the `.sqlite` file with OS-level permissions.
- Consider encrypting the database using third-party libraries if needed.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Benefits and Limitations

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Lightweight and fast** for small apps
- **Zero configuration**‚Äîno server setup
- **Portable**‚Äîjust copy the file
- **Reliable** for embedded and mobile use cases
- **ACID-compliant** with transactional support

### ‚ùå Limitations

- **Poor concurrency**‚Äîsingle writer at a time
- **Limited SQL features**‚Äîno stored procedures, full outer joins, etc.
- **Loose typing**‚Äîcan lead to unexpected behavior
- **No built-in user management**
- **Not ideal for remote or distributed systems**

---

## üö´ Common Beginner Mistakes

- **Assuming strict typing**  
  SQLite allows flexible typing, which can cause bugs if your app expects strict enforcement.

- **Ignoring indexing**  
  Without proper indexes, query performance can degrade quickly as data grows.

- **Overusing triggers**  
  Trigger support is limited and can behave differently than in other databases.

- **Treating it like a server-based DB**  
  SQLite is not designed for high-concurrency or remote access. Trying to scale it like PostgreSQL or MariaDB leads to frustration.

- **Skipping backups**  
  Since everything is in one file, corruption or accidental deletion can be catastrophic without backups.

---

## üß† Other Relevant Details

- **Manifest typing**  
  SQLite uses dynamic typing. Columns have declared types, but values are not strictly enforced.

- **Compatibility**  
  Most SQL modules and ORMs support SQLite, but some advanced features may not be available.

- **Use Cases**  
  - Mobile apps (e.g., Android, iOS)
  - Browser extensions
  - Desktop applications
  - Local caching or prototyping

- **File size limits**  
  SQLite can handle databases up to **140 TB**, but performance typically degrades beyond a few GB without careful optimization.

## üìå Summary

SQLite is a fantastic tool for small, embedded, or local applications. It‚Äôs simple, portable, and fast‚Äîbut not built for high-concurrency or remote access. If your app grows beyond its limits, migrating to a full-featured database like MariaDB or PostgreSQL is often necessary.



SQLite uses database level locking, meaning only one write operation can happen at a time. If multiple parts of your app try to write simultaneously, things can slow down or even fail.
Everything is stored in one file. That‚Äôs great for portability, but it can become a bottleneck for large scale apps or when you need distributed access.
performance tends to degrade once you hit a few gb especially without careful indexing and query optimization
No stored procedures, limited trigger support, and no full outer joins. If your app or framework expects these features, you‚Äôll need workarounds
SQLite doesn‚Äôt offer robust user management or access control like PostgreSQL or MySQL. If your app needs fine-grained permissions, you‚Äôll have to implement them manually
SQLite uses ‚Äúmanifest typing,‚Äù which means it doesn‚Äôt strictly enforce column types. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your app assumes strict typing
Easy to set up no server required
Often used in mobile apps and browser extensions
