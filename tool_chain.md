## fastify 

In the context of your Transcendence project, Fastify handles all the server-side logic. That includes:

Managing player data (scores, profiles, matchmaking) (alternative options form other modules?) 

Handling HTTP requests (like when a player joins a game or sends a move)

Connecting to databases to store and retrieve game info

Serving APIs to your frontend (so the Pong interface can talk to the server)

It’s built on Node.js, so you’ll be writing backend code in JavaScript — and Fastify makes that process fast, clean, and scalable.

### 🔌 Popular Fastify Plugins You Might Use
@fastify/cors: Handles cross-origin requests (important if your frontend is hosted separately)

@fastify/env: Manages environment variables securely

@fastify/swagger: Generates interactive API docs

@fastify/jwt: Adds JSON Web Token authentication

@fastify/static: Serves static files like images or frontend assets

These plugins are modular, so you only include what you need — keeping your backend lean and fast1.

Here’s what Fastify offers to make backend development smoother:

Feature	What It Does
- 🔄 Routing	Defines how your server responds to different URLs (e.g. /start-game, /get-score)
- 📦 Plugin System	Lets you add features like logging, authentication, or CORS without cluttering your core code
- 📑 Schema Validation	Ensures incoming data (like player names or scores) is valid using JSON Schema
- 🔐 Security Plugins	Easily add protections like rate limiting, input sanitization, and HTTPS support
- 📊 Logging	Built-in support for fast, structured logging using Pino
- ⚡ Performance	One of the fastest Node.js frameworks thanks to its low overhead and efficient routing
- 🔄 Async/Await Support	Clean, modern syntax for handling asynchronous operations like database queries
🧩 Swagger Integration	Auto-generates API documentation with plugins like @fastify/swagger

#### random notes 
✅ Many student repositories use Fastify with Node.js successfully, often alongside tools like Prisma (ORM), Redis (caching), and Vite (frontend bundler).
⚠️ Deployment Expectations: Deployment isn’t officially required by the school, but many students go the extra mile to deploy using Docker, Nginx, and HTTPS. This can introduce complexity if you're not careful with Fastify’s static file serving or socket configuration.
