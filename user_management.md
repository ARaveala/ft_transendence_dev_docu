This module delves into the realm of User Management, addressing key aspects of
user interactions and access control within the Pong platform. It encompasses two major
components, each focused on essential elements of user management and authentication: user participation across multiple tournaments and the implementation of remote
authentication.

----
## Major module: Standard user management, authentication and users across tournaments.
- Users can securely subscribe to the website.
- Registered users can securely log in.
- Users can select a unique display name to participate in tournaments.
- Users can update their information.
- Users can upload an avatar, with a default option if none is provided.
- Users can add others as friends and view their online status.
- User profiles display stats, such as wins and losses.
- Each user has a Match History including 1v1 games, dates, and relevant
details, accessible to logged-in users.

The management of duplicate usernames/emails is at your discretion;
please ensure a logical solution is provided.

Explanation: This module is about creating a system that allows users to create accounts, log in with a username and password, and manage their profiles. Itâ€™s the essential starting point for any features that are specific to a logged-in user.

#### Value of this module:
This module is the foundational building block for a personalized user experience. It allows for private data storage and customized settings. By implementing our own system, we gain full control over user data and the authentication flow, which is crucial for building custom features and ensures the application is not dependent on a third party service. (eg to be added)

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This module introduces the critical concept of secure data handling. While you might be familiar with passwords as strings, here we will need to learn about secure hashing and salt, which are essential to protect user information. The overall process of creating a user, storing their data, and verifying their login is a logical flow that we can quickly grasp. The security aspects might be the steepest part of the learning curve.

#### Modules to be Cautious With: 
None. This module provides a foundational service for other modules, making them easier to implement.


#### Complementary Modules:
- Minor module: Use a database for the backend (SQLite)
- Major module: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT
- Major module: Remote authentication (as an alternative login method)
- Major module: Live Chat

To build this module you will need:
- A database to store user data, including hashed passwords
- User-facing forms for registration and login
- A secure password hashing library (bcrypt.js, argon2)
- Session management or a token-based authentication system
- File storage for user avatars

Essential for: Fulfilling the mandatory user authentication requirement and providing the foundation for any user-specific features like profiles, chat, and game history.

----
## Major module: Implement remote authentication.
In this major module, the goal is to implement the following authentication system:
Google Sign-in .

Key features and objectives include:
- Integrate the authentication system, allowing users to securely sign in.
- Obtain the necessary credentials and permissions from the authority to enable
secure login.
- Implement user-friendly login and authorization flows that adhere to best practices and security standards. [provide link to defintion of user friendly and best practises and security standards]
- Ensure the secure exchange of authentication tokens and user information
between the web application and the authentication provider.

----

Explanation: This module gives users the option to log in using an external service, such as Google. Instead of creating a new username and password, they can use their existing account from another service. This provides a convenient and trusted way for users to access the application.

#### Value of this module:
Implementing remote authentication provides several key benefits:
- Convenience: Users don't need to remember another set of credentials, as they can use an account they already have, which improves the user experience.
- Trust: Leveraging a well-known service like Google provides a sense of security and reliability for users, as they are familiar with the authentication process.
- Security: This module offloads the complex task of secure password management and authentication to a trusted third party, reducing the security burden on your application.

###### Beginner-friendly statement:
This is a module where we will be introduced to the completely new concept of OAuth2, a standard for secure communication between services. The learning curve is moderate, but we will need to understand the "dance" of how our application, the user, and an external service like Google securely exchange information. It's more about understanding a new protocol and less about low-level coding challenges.

#### Modules to be Cautious With:
None. This is an alternative login method that can coexist with standard user management.

#### Complementary Modules:
- Major module: Standard user management (as an alternative login method).
- Major module: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT (JWTs are used for session management after the initial Google sign-in).

To build this module you will need:
- A backend to handle the OAuth2 flow
- Google Cloud Console credentials
- A client-side library to initiate the sign-in process (react-google-login)
- A backend library to verify the authentication token (google-auth-library)
- A database to store user information retrieved from Google

This major module aims to provide a remote user authentication, offering users a
secure and convenient way to access the web application.
