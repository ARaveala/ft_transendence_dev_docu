# Major module: Use a framework to build the backend.
In this major module, you are required to use a specific web framework for backend
development: Fastify with Node.js .


(info emoji) You can create the backend without using the constraints of this
module by using the default backend language (as specified above in
the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if you
follow its requirements.
