# Major module: Use a framework to build the backend.
In this major module, you are required to use a specific web framework for backend
development: Fastify with Node.js .


You can create the backend without using the constraints of this
module by using the default backend language [php without frameworks](). However, this module will only be valid if you
follow its requirements. This means using only fastify with node.js .If graphics module is chosen the use of babylon will overwrite this module.

# Minor module: Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end.
Your frontend development must use the Tailwind CSS in addition of the Typescript, and nothing else.

You can create a front-end without using the constraints of this
module by using the default front-end directives (as specified above
in the mandatory part). However, this module will only be valid if
you follow its requirements.
