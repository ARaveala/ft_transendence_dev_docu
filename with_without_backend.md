# üß† Backend vs Frontend-Only: Architecture Overview

This document outlines what each approach enables, limits, and demands based on ft_transcendence constraints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è With a Backend

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **User Authentication**: OAuth2 login (optional; only if external identity is required)
- **Multiplayer Support**: Real-time game coordination via WebSockets
- **Persistent Data**: Scores, profiles, settings, chat logs in a shared database
- **Security**: Backend can sanitize inputs, handle JWTs, and protect against SQL injection/XSS
- **Matchmaking & Tournament Management**: Queue players, schedule matches, and display who‚Äôs playing
- **Aliases Across Sessions**: Track player names, reset automatically with each tournament
- **Docker Friendly**: Runs full backend server and DB in one container
- **Error Handling**: Central place to log and respond to unexpected behavior

### ‚ùå Cons
- Requires backend setup: server, database, API routes
- Higher complexity (e.g. PHP or framework module)
- More files and services to maintain
- Deployment involves more configuration

---

## üßÅ Without a Backend (Frontend-Only)

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Easy to develop and deploy
- All logic runs in the browser (no server needed)
- Can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- Suitable for local demos and prototypes
- Docker image can be minimal (static site or lightweight frontend server)

### ‚ùå Cons
- **No persistent login or user accounts**
  - Can‚Äôt verify identity or use OAuth2
- **No centralized data**
  - Scores, aliases, and game history live only in browser
- **Multiplayer limited**
  - Peer-to-peer possible (via WebRTC), but unstable and hard to scale
- **Matchmaking impossible**
  - Can‚Äôt schedule players across devices or sessions
- **No server-side validation**
  - Vulnerable to cheating, spoofing, and XSS/SQLi risks
- **No shared chat history**
  - Can only use localStorage or in-memory ‚Äî wiped on refresh
- **Reset logic must be manual**
  - Tournament info and aliases must be cleared per session/device

## üîê Security Requirements (Based on Subject Constraints)

Security is **mandatory**, regardless of whether you choose to use a backend.

---

### ‚úÖ Input Validation
- You **must validate all user inputs and forms**.
- If you're building a frontend-only app:
  - Validation must be done **on the base page** (in the browser).
  - Example: JavaScript validation for name fields, score submissions, etc.
- If you're using a backend:
  - Input should be **validated server-side** (in PHP or framework).
  - Prevent malformed requests, unexpected inputs, or unsafe actions.

---

### üß† API & Route Protection
- If your architecture includes **an API**, it must be **secure**.
- You **do not have to use JWT or 2FA** (unless the JWT Security module is active), but:
  - Routes should be protected from unauthorized or spoofed requests.
  - If users can send match results or chat messages, make sure only valid users can do it.
  - Validate tokens or session IDs on server where applicable.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Planning Note
> You can implement a simple alias system instead of a full login.  
> Even without JWT or OAuth2, it's critical that any sensitive route (e.g. storing match results, initiating new games) is protected from abuse or injection.

## ‚úÖ Summary
| Security Feature        | With Backend       | Without Backend       |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Input Validation        | ‚úÖ Server-side checks (e.g. PHP) | ‚úÖ Client-side validation (JavaScript) |
| Route Protection        | ‚úÖ Secure API logic (auth, tokens) | ‚ùå No route protection without backend |
| JWT / 2FA               | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional via module | ‚ùå Not applicable |
| Overall Site Security   | ‚úÖ Server + client protection | ‚úÖ Must handle via frontend controls |
