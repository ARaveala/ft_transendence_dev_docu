⚠️ But... Here's What You Lose
If you skip a backend, you miss out on:
User accounts: No persistent login or profiles
Matchmaking: Hard to support multiplayer unless it's peer-to-peer
Persistence: No database = scores, history, avatars vanish between sessions
Security: Client-only apps can't securely manage authentication or sensitive logic

2. Frontend-only apps = no real persistence
Without a backend, your app can only store data in:
localStorage (survives reloads, but isn’t secure)
sessionStorage (gets wiped when the tab closes)
IndexedDB (a bit more advanced)

But:
These only store data on the user’s own device
You can’t share data across users or keep a central history
You can’t reliably store login sessions or user-specific data (like scores or 2FA)
Cannot do secure authentication due too. 

Frontend-only solutions are fragile, insecure, and local-only
Backend = secure, persistent, centralized data and identity
