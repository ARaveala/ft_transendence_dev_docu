With Backend
- Enables secure user auth, multiplayer state management, persistent storage
- Should ensure cross-browser API and WebSocket support
- You‚Äôll need backend-side error logging and response handling
- Container runs server (PHP or framework), DB, and frontend
Without Backend
- Limits features to local-only or peer-to-peer logic; no centralized user data
- Must handle DOM quirks, caching, or browser inconsistencies entirely in JS
- Client must handle all exceptions gracefully ‚Äî tricky with peer-to-peer or local-only code
- Container runs only frontend server (e.g. Node/React static server) or just serves static files




# Frontend-Only Architecture
‚úÖ Benefits:
- Simplicity: No need to deploy or maintain a server
- Fast setup: All logic and storage in the browser = fewer moving parts/no db
- Quick sharing: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel with minimal fuss
- Great for local demos or prototypes

‚ùå Drawbacks:
- No secure user accounts (no OAuth, no password verification)
- Data lives only on the user‚Äôs device (via localStorage, etc.)
- No multiplayer matchmaking unless using peer-to-peer or third-party services
- Security is minimal ‚Äî everything is exposed in client-side code
- No centralized leaderboard, chat history, or persistent profiles

# Backend-Enabled Architecture
‚úÖ Benefits:
- Authentication: Can integrate with OAuth2 (e.g., 42 API, Google)
- Real-time multiplayer: Handle matchmaking and game sync via WebSockets
- Persistent data: Store scores, avatars, settings, and chat in a shared database
- Security: Backend can manage JWTs, rate-limiting, 2FA, and data validation
- Modularity: Easier to separate concerns (frontend UI vs. backend logic)

‚ùå Drawbacks:
- Complexity: Requires knowledge of backend frameworks (NestJS, Express, etc.)
- More setup: Database, server deployment, API routing
- Maintenance overhead: Server uptime, bug tracking, deployment pipelines

# List of mandatory requirements that may require backend:
- üéÆ Player vs. Player Gameplay & Tournament System
    - Real-time multiplayer needs coordination, game state syncing, and persistent player data ‚Äî difficult (if not impossible) to do securely in the frontend alone. Backend helps manage match queues, results, and tournament flow.
- Protection Against SQL Injections & XSS
    - Implies use of a database, which is a backend component. Securing queries against SQLi is impossible without a server-side layer.
- Must run in Docker	A containerized app
     - typically includes backend services and a database ‚Äî frontend-only SPA doesn‚Äôt justify Docker‚Äôs full purpose.
- Authentication & Persistent Profiles (based on module expectations)	OAuth (e.g. 42 API) requires secure token exchange handled server-side. Storing user accounts and scores needs a database and backend logic.
‚ö†Ô∏è Here's What You Lose if you skip a backend:

- User accounts: No persistent login or profiles
- Matchmaking: Hard to support multiplayer unless it's peer-to-peer
- Persistence: No database = scores, history, avatars vanish between sessions
- Security: Client-only apps can't securely manage authentication or sensitive logic

Frontend-only apps = no real persistence

Without a backend, your app can only store data in:
- localStorage (survives reloads, but isn‚Äôt secure)
- sessionStorage (gets wiped when the tab closes)
- IndexedDB (a bit more advanced)

But:
These only store data on the user‚Äôs own device
You can‚Äôt share data across users or keep a central history
You can‚Äôt reliably store login sessions or user-specific data (like scores or 2FA)
Cannot do secure authentication due too. 

Frontend-only solutions are fragile, insecure, and local-only
Backend = secure, persistent, centralized data and identity
